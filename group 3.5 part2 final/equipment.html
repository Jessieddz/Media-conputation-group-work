          <h3>Clay</h3>
          <p>Clay courts produce the slowest speeds and high bounces due to dusty surface. They are made from crushed shale, stone, and brick. The slow speeds means is favoured by baseline players and ones that like to play with heavy spins and interesting angles. The recognisable red court can be seen being used at the French Open Championships.</p>

          <h3>Grass</h3>
          <p>Grass courts are the traditional surface for playing tennis and can be seen being used at the Wimbledon Championships. They produce the fastest speeds due to its slippery surface and low hard-to-predictable bounce due to the soft, slightly uneven, soil surface. Because of this, grass courts require the player to reach the ball much quicker and will more prefered by net players or players that use serve and volley tactics.</p>

          <h3>Hard</h3>
          <p> Hard courts are the most common surfaces for tennis as they are easiest to maintain. The surface is typically made from either concrete or asphalt. Hard courts are generally considered to be a good middle ground between grass and clay courts in terms of ball speed. Their solid flat surface creates a high but easily predictable bounces from the ball.</p>

          <p> Carpet Courts are the least common of the four and popularly used for indoor matches. The surface is typically made from synethic materials, such as nylon or polyester, and laid upon a firm base. They are uniquely portable; able to be quickly moved and set up. They produce fast speeds and low unpredicaable bounces.</p>
