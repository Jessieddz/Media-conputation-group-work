            <h2>The Stem Turns</h2>
            <p>This is a turn that helps you transition from snowplough to parallel. Beginners should practice on the green pistes first and then practice on the basic blue pistes. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                <ul>
                    <li>Before you turn, you need to let two skis parallel to each other and you need to stand with the basic skiing stance, thus letting the skis are almost parallel to the horizontal direction of pistes, but not completely parallel, if you're completely parallel to the pistes, you're hard to get speed, whcih leads to you're not going to be able to glide, so you need to have the tip of skis slightly facing down the hill, and when you get a little bit of speed through that, You can slowly turn the thigh of the downhill ski inward and turn your ankle to open the ski into a pizza shape. </li>
                    <li>During  the turn, follow the snowplough turn method, keep your center of gravity on the outside ski (downhill ski), and when you are near the end of the turn, let your thigh of downhill ski rotate outward, gradually flat your ankle, and slowly return to the position of parallel skis with the head slightly facing down the hill. </li>
                </ul>

            <p>After you can complete multiple and continuous S-turns with stem turns, you can progress to a parallel turn!</p>

            <h2>The Parallel Turns</h2>
            <p>This is a technique that allows you to glide on more difficult pistes, and is the basis for short turns and carving. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="content">
            <ul>
                <li>Before turning, you still need to maintain the basic stance, and let the two skis parallel, the skis slightly toward down the hill, at this time, in order to keep balanced, your center of gravity must be more on the outside ski (downhill ski) side and the ankle is turned inward. So. when you want to do the turn, you need to let your center of gravity slowly back to the center and gradually flat ankle thus letting your tip skis will be more and more toward down the hill, It's also towards your turn. When the tip skis have about a 45 degree angle with the horizontal line of the pistes and your center of gravity is back in the middle and your ankles are flat, you're ready to turn. </li>
                <li>When you do the turn, keeping the ski parallel, and let the center of gravity on the foot of downhill ski (you can also use the exercise way of snowplough about touching the knee to feel the center of gravity shifting), at the same time, let your ankle gradually slightly inward, so that a rounded bend will appear. </li>
                <li>At the end of the turn, you should bring your  back to the center and back to the foot of downhill ski before starting the next turn. </li>
            </ul>

            <p>After you can complete multiple and continuous S-turns in parallel, you will be able to progress from an intermediate skier to an advanced skier.</p>
