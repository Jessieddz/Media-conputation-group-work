            <h2>The Short Turns</h2>
            <p>This is actually a high frequency parallel turn, which allows you to glide smoothly through black pistes and very complex or narrow terrains. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="content">
            <ul>
                <li>Before turning, the ski needs to remain parallel, so that the tip of skis toward down the hill, at this time slightly let the upper body forward so that shifting the center of gravity from the middle to the forefoot, and look at the direction of the next turn. At the same time, the hand should hold the ski poles on the left front and right front sides of the body, and then through the wrist to swing the ski poles, so that the ski poles point in the corner you will enter the bend. The distance of point by ski poles is best in the front half of your ski to better support your center of gravity and glide, allowing your turn to go around the ski poles. </li>
                <li>When you turn, you need to put more gravity on the foot of the outside (downhill ski), shift the gravity of the forefoot to the whole foot, and roll the skis outward by turning two thighs and two ankles inward at the same time quickly and forcefully. </li>
            </ul>

            <p>After the turn, you need to bring your gravity back to your forefoot and stretch your upper body forward, and to start preparing for the next turn.</p>

            <h2>The Carving</h2>
            <p>This is a technique that allows you to glide at high speed and really start to glide by using the edges of your skis, and it's a skill you need to progress to as an athlete. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                <ul>
                    <li>Before turning, you need to keep the skis parallel, gradually shift your center of gravity from the center to the outside ski (downhill ski), and look ahead to the direction of the turn.</li>
                    <li>When turning, you need to put more gravity on the leg of downhill ski, ensure that the body's center of gravity is built on the downhill ski’s side, and then turn the ankles letting two legs parallel, and let the hip bend and move your hip to the inside of horizontal direction ( also the inside of your turn). At the same time, the outside shoulder can also do a guide, slightly push to the front of the turn, let the body guide the ski and foot, so that a better bend appears. </li>
                    <li>After the turn, you need to stretch your upper part of the body slightly in the direction of the front(next turn) , so you need to reduce the pressure on your downhill ski’s side, bring your gravity back to the center, and start preparing for the next turn.</li>
