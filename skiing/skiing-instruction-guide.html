            <h2>HISTORY</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>The earliest skis date back to 8000 BC, with wood and horesehair skis found in Russia and northern China, 
                  while many broken skis have been found in Norway, Sweden and Finland. 
                  The first written record of skiing was found in China, probably from 206 BC to 220 AD, and it was a record of a primitive skis called MuMa. 
                  At that time, people used skiing as a survival tool for hunting and waging war. </li>
                  <li>By the 19th century, skiing had become a popular sport, 
                  and the design of skis had developed during this period, 
                  from the Telemark Ski with a side cut design to the steel edge ski with better grip,
                   which also promoted to the skiing techniques, at that time stem turn and parallel turn were invented.</li> 
                   <li>By the 1930s, skiing became popular in Europe, North America, Japan, Australia, Chile, and Argentina.</li> 
                   In 1924, the first Winter Olympics were held in Chamonix, France. 
                   That same year, a big change came with the invention of the ski chair. 
                   In 1936, the first ski chair was installed in Sun Valley, Idaho, people do not  need to climb a hill thus affecting the skiing experience. 
                   Because they no longer have to climb to the top of the hill. 
                  <li>In the mid-1990s, the first twin-tip skis were invented, and because skiing became more and more popular sport around the world, 
                   ski resorts also were built more and more, until now, skiing is becoming an increasingly popular sport(Mabey ski, 2025).</li>
