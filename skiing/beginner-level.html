            <h2>Familiar with ski gear</h2>
            <p>Ski gears mainly include helmets, snow goggles, skiing shoes, skis and poles.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <ul>
                    <li>Snow goggles: Put the snow goggles on the outside of the helmet, and ensure the band of the snow goggles is not too tight, and does not compress the skin to pull the eyes to affect the line of sight, different light needs to choose different snow goggles, for example, it is best to choose the transparent lens at night, choose the darker lens when there are glaring sunlight.</li>
                    <li>Helmet: Measure the head circumference to choose the appropriate size of the helmet, after wearing, buckle the helmet band, but can not be too tight or too loose, after tying, can not strangle the neck to prevent the fall of the neck injury resulting in danger, can not let the helmet do greatly shake on the head, so that the helmet is shaken off, which can not play a protective role. You only need to place the strap of the helmet just one finger below your lower jaw to get the right amount of tightness.</li>
                    <li>Ski shoes: First of all, we need to put on socks, and ensure that the socks are not stacked, otherwise after wearing snowshoes, the stacked socks will squeeze the calves. Then,pulling down the tongue of the shoe, after tiptoe to wear it, and then stamp on the heel, so that the whole foot can enter the snowshoes. Finally, locking the shoes buckle from the nearest tiptoe, can not lock it very tight, but also can not be very loose, a standard is when you feel your calf in the snow shoes no gap shaking, and feel the calf tightly fit the tongue of the snow shoe, this tightness is appropriate.</li> 
                    <li>Skis: ski is divided into release point, toe piece, ski brake and so on, when wearing, we need to let tiptoe align with the toe piece, then let the heel align with release point, step down. When clicking out the ski, use the tip of the ski pole into the indentation on top of the heel piece and press down. The release point will automatically work, you feet will be removed.</li>
                    <li>Ski pole: carried only and used when required for skiing.</li>

                <li>Bend the ankles, knees and hips so that the angles of the three joints are the same, so that the tilt angle of the upper body (the angle formed by the bending of the hips) and the tilt angle of the lower calves (the Angle formed by the bending of the knees and ankles) are parallel, so that the shoulders, knees and toes are in a vertical line, so that the knees are in the direction of the skis, and the gravity is placed at the center of the feet, not the tip of the foot or the heel. </li>
                <li>Hold the skis with hands and place it diagonally in front of you so that you can just see both hands.</li>

            <h2>The Snowplough and The Snowplough Turns</h2>
            <p>When you can do snowplough and snowplough tuens, you can glide smoothly on the green pistes.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="content">

                    <h2>The snowplough</h2>
                    <p>The snowplough brake, also known as pizza because of its shape like a slice of pizza. This technique allows you to exercise good speed control on green pistes.</p>
                    <div class="cardcontent">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Skiers can first wear one ski on flat ground, let the thigh turn inward to change the direction of the ski, so that the tip of the ski toward the inside side, the tail of ski toward the outside, so that to find the feeling of thigh power, after both feet complete the movement on flat ground and familiar with the exercise. 
                            The skier can go to the most basic piste to try.</li>
                        <li>At this time, the skier should keep the two skis parallel, vertically toward the piste, use the power of the thigh to let the two skisâ€™ tip turn inward and the tail of skis toward the outside,  so as to show the shape of pizza. Then let the ankle turn inward  (ankle will become more closer with the pistes surface), let the inside edge of the ski rub with the piste , thereby slowing down. </li>
                        <li>During this time, the skier needs to keep the center of gravity in the center of the skis at all times, and keep the hip, knee and ankle bend in the basic skiing stance, and ensure that the calf is attached to the tongue of the snowshoe, so that the center of gravity is always forward, preventing the center of gravity backward due to increasing speed thus leading to fall . </li>
                        <li>You can do this technique by constantly accelerating and then slowing down with it to practice it. So you have to keep switching between accelerating and slowing down. First of all, get your skis parallel straight down the hill, you will get a little bit of speed, at this time, you should use the snowplough brake to slow down until it stops, and at that point, you need to get your skis parallel again to get the speed that allows you to do a new brake, how do you get your skis parallel again? All you have to do is letting your ankles not rotate inward, but flat, and rotate your thighs outward, then your skis will become parallel and the tip of skis down the hill.</li>

                    <h2>The snowplough turn</h2>
                    <p>The snowplough turn allows skiers to control the direction on the green pistes. </p>
                    <div class="cardcontent">
                    <ul>
                        <li>First, the skiers need to maintain a snowplough brake position with the skier's center of gravity in the middle.</li>
                        <li>Because we need to use the skis to control the direction and now the skis are in the shape of pizza, so if we need to turn right, we need to put more gravity on the left side of body(downhill ski side) so that the skis have more friction with the snow pistes, thus automatically change the direction and start to turn, if we need to turn left, we need to use more gravity on the right side of body. </li>
                        <li>But question is how to you shift your gravity from the middle to the a side of body? There is a way to practice, for example, when you need to turn right, you should put more gravity on the left side of body, you can touch the outside of the left knee to deliberately reduce the power on the right side and put more weight on the left side thus shift your center of gravity. When turning, keep your weight on your left side until a rounded turn ends. At the end of the turn, bring your gravity back to the center and start turning right. Turn right is same, just do the exercises in the opposite side.</li>

                    </div>
                    <p>When you can glide multiple S-shaped plow turns in a row, you can ski on green pistes and basic blue pistes and progress to intermediate skiers!</p>
