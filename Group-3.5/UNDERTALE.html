    <h1>ABOUT</h1>
    <p>Undertale is a beloved indie roleplay video game released in 2015 by American indie game developer Toby Fox with additional art by Temmie Chang. The game uses many typical game mechanics of traditional RPGs but subverts them in a way that weaves a compelling story of choice and morality. Mostly notably, the player is not required to kill any enemies like they would in traditional RPGs and can instead choose to between fighting, killing, befriending and sparing the monsters you come across. Your choices will affect the story and leads you to one of the game's many possible endings. Known for its humor, emotional depth, nostalgic soundtrack, and unique mechanics, Undertale subverts classic game tropes, offering a memorable experience full of surprises.</p>

    <h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
    <p>A human child falls into the Underground, a vast world of monsters that lies under the Earth's surface, separated from the human world by a magical barrier. The player controls the child as they explore each of the Underground's colourful regions, discover many hidden secrets, and encounter numerous unique characters that you may choose to befriend or fight. In your journey back to the surface, the choices you make will determine your outcome. How will you face the challenges thrown your way? </p>

  <section>
    <h1>HOW TO PLAY</h1>
    <h2>ENCOUNTERS</h2>
    <p> Throughout the game you will be thrown into 'FIGHT' encounters, in which the player switching between choosing how to interact with their enemy and dodging their attacks in 'bullet hell combat'. Your enemy will have many dynamic dialouges and reactions to your actions.</p>
    <section style="display:flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 5px; row-gap: 15px; margin-top: 0%; box-shadow:none">
      <p style='margin: auto;'> When if it is your turn to make a move, there are four main options you can choose from:</p>
      <div class="card" style="width:100%;">
      <img src="FIGHT_sprite_button.png" alt="A 16-bit image of button with an icon of a sword and the word 'FIGHT'" style="width: 120px; margin-bottom: 0%;">
      <p>Choosing this option allows you to pick a monster to attack and potentially kill. The game will will prompt you with a quick-time bar, with a bar sliding over a meter. You must press [Z] or [ENTER]  before the bar moves all the way across the meter in order to deal an attack. To deal an attack with the most damage, you must press [Z] or [ENTER] so that the moving bar lands on central meter point. If the monster's HP is low enough, their name will change colour, indicating they can be spared. If the monster's HP reaches zero, the monster will die and be turned to dust.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card" style="width:100%;">
      <img src="ACT_sprite_button.png" alt="A 16-bit image of button with an icon of a sound-wave and the word 'ACT'" style="width: 120px; margin-bottom: 0%;">
      <p>A more sociable way of interacting with monsters during an encounter; there are many ways to 'ACT' depending what monster you are engaged with. Using ACT can be another method of peacefully ending a fight and is must safer option compared to FIGHTing the enemy.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card" style="width:100%;">
      <img src="ITEM_sprite_button.png" alt="A 16-bit image of button with an icon of a drawstring bag and the word 'ITEM'" style="width: 120px; margin-bottom: 0%;">
      <p>Items can help you regain HP and possibly increase your other stats.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card" style="width:100%;">
      <img src="MERCY_sprite_button.png" alt="A 16-bit image of button with an icon of a thin cross and the word 'MERCY'" style="width: 120px; margin-bottom: 0%;">
      <p>Sparing allows you to end the fight without killing your opponent. In order to spare, you must have survived the encounter long enough for this option to become avaliable for your enemy. This is indicated when their name tag to change colour</p>
    <br>
    </div>
  </section>
  <h2>Non-Combat</h2>
  <p>When not engaged in combat, Undertale offers exploration, puzzle-solving, and interaction with a vibrant cast of characters. Players navigate through various environments, uncovering secrets, lore, and humorous encounters. Conversations with NPCs are lively, often revealing hidden details about the world and its inhabitants.<br>
  Every decision‚Äîbig or small‚Äîshapes the world and affects future encounters, making exploration and interaction just as important as battles.</p>
</section>
  <section>
    <h1>ENDINGS</h1>
    <p>There are three main endings you can achieve.</p>
    <section style= "display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 5px; row-gap: 15px; box-shadow:none">
      <div class="card" style="height: 740px;">
        <h2>TRUE PACIFIST</h2>
        <br>
        <img src="true pacifist.webp" alt="A 16-bit image of serveral major characters smiling happy within a dark spotlighted room.">
        <p>Considered the 'true ending' of the game, this route requires you to first complete a neutral route, then replay the final battle. You will have had to have spared every monster you had come across, befriended the core characters (particularly Papyrus, Undyne, Alphys) and explored the False Lab. The True Pacifist Route ends with the barrier being broken, and both the human and the monsters of the Underground being freed. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card" style="height: 740px;">
        <h2>NEUTRAL</h2> 
        <br>
        <img src="neutral.webp" alt="A 16-bit image of speech bubble. Sans the Skeleton speaks with his eyes closed, '*so...*it's been a while.">
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>These endings occurs if not all the requirements of the other two routes have been met. This route ends with the human escaping back to the surface alone and then later recieving a call from Sans, who updates the player on the fate of the Underground due to their influence. This can have many variations based on your previous choices.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card" style="height: 740px;">
        <h2>GENOCIDE</h2>
        <img src="destroyed_game.jpg" alt="A 16-bit image of a screen covered wwith red nines, indicated an unimaginabel attack of damage as been dealt.">
        <p>This ending occurs if you to choose kill every possible monster you come across. This will result many changes to the story and beyond ‚Äî as it results in the complete destruction of the game's world.  If the player try to re-launch the game after a completed Genocide Route, the protagonist must give up their SOUL to a mysterious character in exchange for the recreation of the world. From there, the game will still be permenantly altered, with the other endings being affected. </p>
