          <h2>General Summary</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>All content blocks were grouped inside containers with visible colours and shadows, making it easy for readers to digest the information.</li>
          <li>Each section was structured with semantic HTML elements like 'header', 'nav', 'main' and 'footer' to ensure clean document structure and readability.</li>
          <li>A navigation bar was implemented to allow quick access to any section on the page, improving the user experience and usability of the webpages.</li>
          <li>A carousel component was used to make the webpage more dynamic and space-efficient, helping to avoid the clutter of information.</li>
          <li>Custom fonts were imported through google fonts to improve the aesthetics of the website allowing for a more readable page</li>
          <li>A flexbox layout was applied to content areas an the navigation to allow viewing on different devices which may have differing sizes</li>
          <li>Hover effects were implemented to create a more interactive and dynamic webpage  which would in turn enhance user engagement through CSS animations.</li>

      <h2>HTML</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Alt text: allows people unable to see the images on screen to still be able to digest and understand all the information being depicted.</li>
        <li>Anchor <a>: creates links to other web pages, to add fun and connectivity.</li>
        <li>Div: Names and divides different parts of the content, giving them the same or different class names depending on needs, to make all of the information more organised.</li>
        <li>Figure</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Figure: Includes image and the caption of the image and lets it look like a whole section thus improving clarity within the webpage.</li>
          <li>Image: adds an image to the web page, making it more fun and vivid.</li>
          <li>Fig caption: show the sources, like where the picture is from.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>List</li>
        <ul>

        </ul>
        <li>Line Break (br): adds a small line break between content. This can improve readability as it separates/spaces/divides bits of information.</li>

          <li>Main: The section in which we put the main body of information (that doesn’t belong in the header, footer, or nav bar) so the user can see all specific and important information within one big section</li>
          <li>Navigation Bar: enables seamless movement between web pages. Each personal webpage features a fixed navigation bar, allowing viewers to easily enter and exit pages throughout the website.

Additionally, the navigation bar includes a logo and hyperlinks, strengthening connections between various web pages.</li>
          <li>Sections: clearly divides each category of information in a way that is understandable to the readers</li>
