          <h2>🎯 Game Rules</h2>
          <img src="download (3).jpeg" alt="Tennis scoring diagram" class="uniform" />
          <p>
            Tennis is unique in its scoring and match structure. A game starts at "love" (zero)
            and progresses through points — 15, 30, 40 — until a player wins the game. When both
            players reach 40, the score is called “deuce,” and a player must secure a two-point
            advantage to win that game. Sets typically consist of six or more games, and matches are
            usually decided in a best-of-three or best-of-five format.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other key rules include the requirement for the ball to land within the boundaries of
            the court, and in doubles, communication and positioning add further complexity.

          <h2>🎾 How to Play</h2>
          <img src="download (7).jpeg" alt="Player serving the ball" class="uniform" />
          <p>
            Mastering tennis starts with learning fundamental techniques. The serve is the first
            stroke of every point. Toss the ball with a controlled motion and hit it at the peak of
            your swing with a consistent follow-through. Once the point begins, players use forehand
            and backhand strokes to return the ball.
          </p>
          <p>
            Understanding when to play aggressively versus defensively is crucial. Drills,
            repetition, and coaching feedback are recommended to improve consistency.

          Court surfaces greatly affect playing style. Hard courts deliver a consistent bounce, clay
          slows the game with higher friction, and grass courts offer a faster pace with unpredictable
          bounces.

          <h2>📈 Strategies</h2>
          <img src="download.png" alt="Tennis Strategy Diagram" class="uniform" />
          <p>
            Excelling in tennis requires technical skill and smart strategy. In singles, effective
            baseline play and shot placement are key, while doubles emphasize teamwork and net coordination.
          </p>
          <p>
            Observe professional matches to learn how strategies adapt during in-game situations.
            Experiment with pace, spin, and shot selection for continuous improvement.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mental fortitude is equally important—staying focused under pressure can turn the tide of a match.
            Players often develop rituals or routines between points to manage nerves and maintain concentration.
          </p>
          <p>
            Court awareness, footwork, and anticipation help players position themselves optimally.
            Reading an opponent's body language and predicting shot direction can provide a significant edge.
          </p>
          <p>
            Advanced strategies involve mixing up shot depth and speed, using drop shots, lobs, and angled volleys
            to disrupt the opponent’s rhythm. Understanding your own strengths—and your opponent's weaknesses—
            allows you to tailor tactics effectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, strategic stamina is critical. Even the best tactics won’t work without the endurance to
            sustain them over long matches. Players incorporate fitness routines, stretching, and recovery practices
            into their training to ensure peak performance when it matters most.
